# Showcase media assets

Add your screenshots or GIFs referenced by the example and root README files here. Suggested filenames:

- `images/showcase_single_page.gif`
- `images/showcase_multi_page.gif`
- `images/showcase_pdf_preview.png`
- `images/showcase_capabilities.gif`

Keeping the assets in this directory ensures the Markdown placeholders resolve locally and inside pub.dev docs.
